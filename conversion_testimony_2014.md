\*To be compared with the `conversion\_testimony.md` file



As a child, I was aggressive, rebellious, capricious. I was about 10 years old when I first came to an evangelical church. 

Given my young age, I quickly joined the Sunday school, where I first heard about Jesus.

During my years in middle school, I started to read a few books of the Bible but I had not yet had any personal experience with the Lord.

But at the age of 13, I went to a teen camp in the South of France, and things started to change.

I lived intense spiritual moments there and during a evangelization night, I gave my heart to Jesus in response to a call after having watched a video about the end times.

From then on, I began to serve the Lord in the group of young people that I had just joined but I did not want to be baptized right away.



At the end of 2005, during a spiritual church camp, I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit during an intense moment of prayer and by laying hands. 

This was the trigger that a year later pushed me to go through the waters of baptism.

It has therefore been more than seven years \[in 2014, when I wrote this testimony] since I was baptized and I serve and follow the Lord with love and perseverance. 

I am happy to have made the right choice and I do not regret it.

It is the most beautiful thing that has happened in my life and the Lord is an integral part of it. 

I consider myself privileged to have been able to know the Lord so early. I cannot live without him.

The Lord changed my character and he still does it today.
