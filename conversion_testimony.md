I was born into a family where nobody knew the Lord.

In my family, there are non-believers and Jehovah’s Witnesses.

As a child, I was even looked after by a Muslim nanny for a year and a half.

I had an aggressive, impulsive, rebellious and capricious character. I did not have any problems or particular needs.

I just wanted to be a good student and succeed in life. I had a life that I would describe as normal.

I lived with my mother and my sister, my father did not live with me during his lifetime. I was a very good student at school, even considered as gifted.

I was neither interested in God, Jesus or the Bible but I remember going sometimes to a Catholic church.



\### First contacts with the faith



When I was 9 years old, our then neighbor started talking about Jesus to my mother, and she converted.

This happened after my father’s death, before I was ten. Following my mother’s conversion, she began to attend an evangelical church, and I followed her.

I remember entering an evangelical church for the first time at the end of 2000 and in 2001 I went to Sunday school, in Sarcelles.

It was there that I heard the Gospel for the first time. The Word of God made me understand that Jesus is the truth.

As I was studying in junior high school, I started reading the Bible, but without having any personal experience with the Lord.



\### Personal conversion



Then, in the summer after my 13th birthday, things started to change during a teen camp in the South of France.

I experienced intense spiritual moments there for the first time.

And during a night of Gospel preaching, I gave my life to Jesus during a call, after having watched a video about the end times.

I gave my life to him because I was touched by the power of the Gospel and the impact it has on believers around me.

I wanted to become like them and look like Jesus.



\### After my conversion



Since then, my behavior has changed, I am no longer aggressive and calmer, God has taken the first place in my life and my main focus.

The new life in Jesus is better than before, I know that I am saved, that he supports me, guides me and speaks to me.

I would so much like the people around me to know Jesus and to be saved in their turn as I was.

My goal is to live with the Lord, to serve him, please him, obey him. What I do every day with the help of the Spirit of God.

As I face the trials and difficulties of life, I experience peace, I do not panic, I pray, I lean on the Lord.

I strongly Believe I will never regret having chosen to follow Jesus and to be his disciple.
