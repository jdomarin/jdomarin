- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jdomarin, a French DevOps Cloud R&D engineer, initially software backend developer, currently working for Ekinops at Sophia Antipolis, France
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, big data and data processing, Python/Golang/Rust programming, DevOps and automation including CI/CD
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning main cloud and automation technologies, especially Terraform, Ansible, Azure
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: search for "jdomarin" on Facebook, Instagram, Stack Overflow and/or "JÃ©rÃ©my Domarin" on the aforementioned social media and LinkedIn
- Many websites online and smartphone apps where a profile of mine resides, redirect to this GitHub repository

This folder includes:
- This README file
- A .gitignore
- My resume/curriculum vitae in English and French
- My Developer Story from Stack Overflow which no longer includes this feature
- Two versions of my testimony saying how I became a born again disciple of Jesus-Christ, in French only -- English version might come later on
