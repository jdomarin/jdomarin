# Introduction

This file explains how I became the owner of a property in Vallauris, Alpes-Maritimes, France, in 2024.

I'm writing this file because I believe it can help others embark on the adventure of their first property purchase.


At the beginning of 2024, I began to feel unhappy living in the apartment I had lived in for ten years: dilapidated, work not carried out or planned by the owner, cramped conditions, poor thermal and sound insulation, high humidity and heat in summer, noisy and disruptive neighbors.


# Key Steps and Dates


## Project Definition and Research


* 2024-01-07: It is the first Sunday of the year. My friend and neighbor, whom I helped move into the apartment she bought in 2022, invites me to her home. We talk about buying a property, among other things. She gives me the name of a real estate broker: **CAFPI**.

* At that time, even if I wanted to move, my priority was to rent a two-room apartment in Antibes. I was not considering becoming a homeowner.

* 2024-03-15: I had my first appointment with CAFPI, a real estate broker, to assess the economic feasibility of a property purchase. Given my savings and income, it turned out I couldn't buy a property being sold above €230,000.

* March-April-May: I looked at property listings on *Le Bon Coin* and *Se Loger*, looking for that rare gem, with well-defined criteria (see next section).

* 2024-04-14: Seven balconies facing the sea collapsed on the Bégonia building of the Vauban residence in Antibes. It was the closest building to the one I was living in at the time, and I used to walk past it to get to my car. For the next two weeks, the pedestrian path in the residence was modified, and access to balconies and private gardens was prohibited for three months.


## Apartment Visits


* 2024-05-23: I began calling the sellers of the properties I had pre-selected for possible visits. The first appointments were scheduled.

* 2024-05-29: I visited a first 41 sq. m, two-room apartment in Antibes, near the *Pôle d'Echanges* (coach station near the SNCF train station), a five-minute walk from where I  lived at that time. I did not choose it because it was narrow, old, and required much renovation.

* 2024-06-01: I visited another 49 sq. m, two-room apartment in Antibes, near the Rabiac cemetery. I did not choose it because there were too many steps to access the apartment, it was too noisy due to its proximity to a steep bend, there were cracks, and the parquet flooring was poorly laid. After this visit, I decided to expand my search to neighboring towns, particularly Vallauris and Golfe Juan.

* 2024-06-14: I visited a third 51 sq. m, 2 (or 3?) room apartment in Golfe Juan, on the main road, across from the Catholic church. I did not choose it because it was noisy and too expensive.

* 2024-06-21: I visited a fourth 63 sq. m, 3-room apartment in Vallauris, near the football stadium. It had everything going for it; my companion was won over.


## Choosing the property, financing, and preparing the real estate transaction


* 2024-06-26: I tell the seller of the apartment I had visited five days earlier that I wanted to buy the property he was putting up for sale. We agreed on a selling price of €220,000.

* 2024-07-08: At lunch time, I have a second appointment at CAFPI in Antibes to have a list of possible financing options to buy the apartment in Vallauris. CCE seems to be the favorite.

* 2024-07-11: I sign the sales agreement with the seller at the notary office *Falgon et associés* in Le Cannet, Alpes-Maritimes. The final signing of the deed of sale must take place before October 4th, otherwise the sale is canceled. I therefore give up on having a one-week vacation on the Crozon Peninsula in early September.

* 2024-07-22: I am done paying the full notary fees, calculated at €11.4k, or 5% of the sale price (it can go up to 10%).

* 2024-07-29: I get a favorable response from my broker from Société Générale, in Golfe Juan, Alpes-Maritimes, regarding the financial aspect of the property purchase.

* 2024-08-09: I ask to open a bank account with Société Générale, at the Golfe Juan branch, between Antibes and Cannes.

* 2024-08-16: I notify the landlord of my property in Antibes that I will be leaving by September 30th and propose setting the exit inventory for that date. The landlord accepts.

* 2024-08-23: My bank account at Société Générale is opened.

* 2024-08-24: I subscribe a home insurance for my future home in Vallauris with SOGESSUR, the home insurance company of Société Générale. This is a prerequisite for signing the sales agreement.

* 2024-09-02: I receive the loan offer from Société Générale in Golfe-Juan: €201,000 for a 25-year loan at an interest rate of 3.7%. The legal cooling-off period does not allow me to sign the loan offer before September 13th.

* 2024-09-03: I manage with my employer to have my salary deposited at Société Générale, no longer at BoursoBank. This is a prerequisite for signing the sales agreement. All my salaries since September 2024 have been paid into my SG account.

* 2024-09-09: I request the closure of my Home Savings Plan at La Banque Postale, which involves the use of 100% of the funds in it, approximately €33,000 at the time.

* 2024-09-13: I sign the loan offer from Société Générale in Golfe Juan. This releases the funds, which are transferred to the notary the following Monday.

* 2024-09-15: I start packing for the move.

* 2024-09-16: The Home Savings Plan closure request is processed, its funds are now available.

* 2024-09-17: I make the final transfer to the notary (€23,600), which seals the signing of the deed of sale, scheduled for six days later.

* 2024-09-20: In the evening, a 10-day vacation period begins for me, ending in the morning of October 1st. The move is scheduled for the following week.

* 2024-09-23: I sign the final deed of sale at the notary office and become the owner of a 3-room apartment in Vallauris. The same day evening, I begin moving there.

* 2024-09-30: I give back the keys of the one-room apartment I've been renting since 2014, at the Vauban residence in Antibes.


# Criteria for choosing a property


* Minimum surface area of ​​40 sq. m

* Price per square meter less than or equal to €4,500

* Parking space attached to the property

* Quiet neighborhood and surroundings, within walking distance of shops

* Geographically close to Antibes and Sophia Antipolis

* Apartment, building, and/or residence eligible for fiber optic internet, very important for remote working

* Lowest possible condominium fees, ideally less than €1,800 per year.

* No ground floor and, if possible, not on the top floor

* Property management company with no pending proceedings

* No intermediary (e.g., agencies) between seller and buyer


# Financial Considerations


* Up to €58,000 total down payment, including €33,000 from a PEL (Personal Savings Plan), €44,000 used

* Bank loan of €201,000 over 25 years at 3.7% (monthly payments of €1,060 including SG's borrower insurance)

* Calling broker services cost me €2,500, but it relieved me of having to contact banks myself to get a loan and have higher risk to fail at it.

* The down payment is supposed to cover at least 20% of the sale price.


# Why I chose this apartment


It met most of the criteria: it's spacious, fresh, bright, and on the first floor. The seller, a private individual, was understanding, cooperative, and available.

The neighborhood is quiet, the building overlooks the street, and the exterior views from inside the apartment give the impression of living in a country house!
